# MPIEMSES3D
3D Plasma Electromagnetic Particle MPI Parallel Simulator with the OhHelp Library

**MPIEMSES3D** is a high-performance simulation tool designed for 3D plasma electromagnetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations.
Using **MPI (Message Passing Interface)** for parallel computing, this simulator efficiently handles complex electromagnetic particle dynamics in large-scale simulations.
The integration with **the OhHelp library** further enhances this tool by adding dynamic load-balancing capabilities that optimize performance across distributed computing environments.

## Features

- **3D Plasma Electromagnetic Particle Simulations**: Simulate interactions between electromagnetic fields and particles within a 3D domain.

- **MPI Parallelism**: Supports distributed memory parallelism using MPI, allowing simulations to scale across multiple processors.

- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Powered by the OhHelp library, `MPIEMSES3D` dynamically distributes computation across processors, improving performance in heterogeneous or unbalanced systems.

- **Support for Custom Boundary Conditions**: Incorporates boundary condition handling using another library `finbound`.
- **Coupled Computations**: Supports coupled computations with other programs using the CoToCoA framework.

## Clone
This repository has submodules. To clone the repository, use the `--recursive` option to clone the submodules as well.
Run the following command:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Nkzono99/MPIEMSES3D.git
```

## Install
The simulator has three modes: **normal**, **cotocoa requester**, and **cotocoa worker**.
To build the simulator, simply run the following command in the root directory.
The executable file (`mpiemses3D`) will be generated in `MPIEMSES3D/bin` upon successful compilation:

In **normal** mode:
```bash
make
```
In **cotocoa requester** mode:
```bash
make requester
```
In **cotocoa worker** mode:
```bash
make worker
```

Sample code for **cotocoa requester** mode is available [here](https://github.com/kmr-gks/EMSES-CoToCoA-sample.git).

## Dependencies

The simulator relies on the following libraries:

### [OhHelp Library Package: Version 1.1.1 (2015/10/23)](http://www.para.media.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ohhelp/) <sup>1</sup>

The OhHelp library provides scalable, domain-decomposing dynamic load balancing essential for efficient particle-in-cell simulations across multiple processors.
It is particularly well-suited for cases where computational loads vary significantly across the simulation domain.
