This folder contains sample code.

You need to compile CoToCoA and the sample code in order to run them.

Run `make` in the `src` and `test` directories, respectively.

After that, submit a job file (.sh).

example:
```
sbatch sample1_camphor.sh
```

The software is intended to be used on Kyoto University's supercomputer system A (camphor).
